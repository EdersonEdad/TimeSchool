            &emsp;&emsp;The National Nutrition Council Technical Committee approved through ad referencum the theme for this year’s 
                        Nutrition Month campaign in July which is “New normal na nutrisyon, sama-samang gawan ng solusyon!”. The theme 
                        calls for strengthened nutrition interventions and solidarity towards nutrition improvement as the country shifts 
                        towards living with the COVID-19 virus. The theme signifies the key role of nutrition in building resilience from 
                        pandemic to endemic paradigm. The term “new normal” was adopted to signify a transition to a better normal while 
                        bringing the positive impacts of the pandemic to become more resilient and to prevent future pandemics.

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The pandemic has made a huge impact on nutrition such as disruptions in the delivery of nutrition and related services, 
                        increased hunger incidence due, and many more. But there are also positive impacts such as innovation in service delivery, 
                        home food production, increased awareness of one’s health and consuming healthy diets, and the solidarity amongst the people 
                        to help each other.</p>

                &emsp;&emsp;The Nutrition Month campaign aims to highlight the importance of nutrition in recovery, stimulate discussions on how 
                            to build back better the design and delivery of nutrition interventions, and encourage the participation of various 
                            sectors to promote nutrition. The campaign calls upon stakeholders to implement evidence-based and innovative solutions 
                            to increase resilience and improved nutrition outcomes. Nutrition Month will also call upon nutrition advocates influence
