            &emsp;&emsp;The celebration of Buwan ng Wika continues amidst the pandemic. The Grade School Department had 
                        virtual activities held last August 25-27, 2021. The theme of this year’s celebration, “Filipino 
                        at mga Wikang Katutubo sa Dekolonisasyon ng Pag-iisip ng mga Pilipino.” Students from Grades 1 to 6 
                        and the teachers as well, participated in the celebration. There’s the usual wearing of Filipiniana costume, 
                        some with headdress and an added feature of fashionable face masks, still following the Filipiniana theme. 
                        At the culminating program, various activities were showcased by the students from different levels. 
                        They displayed their amazing talents in music, dance, poetry, arts, speech, and games as a tribute to our 
                        identity as a people.

                &emsp;&emsp;The First Graders had Saya-Wit which is a combination of Filipino dance and song. They also had short 
                            storytelling through video presentations. The Second Graders showed their creativity through book mark 
                            making which was called “Tatak Ko’y Pilipino”, showing good manners of Filipino children and an Acrostic 
                            for “Wikang Filipino”. The Third Graders displayed their ability to speak the Filipino language fluently 
                            and with pride through Tongue Twisters (Pampilipit-Dila). Another activity is Poster Making which showcased 
                            the talent of the students in drawing and gave importance to the love of reading Filipino books and literature.
