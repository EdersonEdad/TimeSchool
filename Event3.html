            &emsp;&emsp;Philippine Independence Day is celebrated every June 12th. It is a national holiday that commemorates the 
                        day when Filipinos broke free from three centuries of Spanish rule.From 1565 to 1898, the Philippines was 
                        colonized by the Spaniards. During this time, Filipinos were treated unjustly and discriminated against â€“ 
                        they were not given equal rights and opportunities. No Filipino was allowed to hold position in higher offices. 
                        Not everyone was given access to education. Many were oppressed and forced to work without pay. They did not even 
                        have the freedom to buy anything they wanted to buy. They were like strangers in their own country. Imagine not being 
                        able to do whatever you want in your own home and instead being told what you should and should not do.
