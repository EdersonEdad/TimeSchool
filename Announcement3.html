            &emsp;&emsp;The Philippines will celebrate its 125th Independence Day, June 12. Official events will likely occur 
                        nationwide at government buildings and other key sites, including the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite 
                        Province, the historical site of the proclamation of independence. In Metro Manila, authorities will close 
                        parts of Roxas Boulevard, as well as Katigbak Parkway, South, and Independence roads to facilitate related 
                        events and parades. Dozens to hundreds of people will probably participate in each event, especially in urban 
                        centers like Metro Manila.
