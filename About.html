                                    to exchange ideas and details about their classes and assignments. However, it's also crucial 
                                    because it allows managers to stay in constant contact with teachers, saving time when it comes 
                                    to event planning and educational planning.</p>
                            
                                <p>&bullet;&emsp;This School website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear navigation menus 
                                and search features that allow visitors to quickly and easily find the information they need. In addition 
                                to providing static content, many school websites also incorporate interactive features such as online forums, 
                                and social media integration, allowing students, parents, and teachers to connect and engage with each other online.

                                Overall, a school website is an essential tool for modern educational institutions, serving as a central hub for communication, 
                                information sharing, and community building.</p>

                            <div class = "des-who">&emsp;&emsp;Hi! I am Ederson Edad, the author of this website. One of the most difficult things to accomplish 
                                            is to describe oneself, but it's also fascinating to do so. I think that our characteristics, whether they are good or 
                                            bad, define who we are to the outside world. People can have different perspectives on my personality depending on what 
                                            they want to see in me, and that's good. I would therefore identify myself in terms of the multiple perspectives I view 
                                            myself from. I am just an ordinary guy who have a ordinary life. I like playing online games, watching anime and reading 
                                            books and mangas. I studied at Southern Luzon State University of Bachelor Science of Computer Engineering.
