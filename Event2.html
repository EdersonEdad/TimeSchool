            &emsp;&emsp;  Nutrition Month Celebration is a great occasion that should be given importance as one of the solutions to 
                          the Nation’s issue on hunger and malnutrition. School as being the main ground of children’s different activities 
                          and molder of youth is the best place to reach all concerns and spread the nutrition message or increase awareness 
                          regarding hunger issues and the possible solution to gradually solve this problem. 
                          
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; In connection to this, the TimeSchool Studetns celebrates the Nutrition Month with the theme “Healthy Diet, Gawing Habit - for Life!.

                            and parents of TimeSchool Elementary School actively celebrated the whole Nutrition Month.
